# I haven't really done any type of coding before but I'm looking forward to learning code so I can develop video games.
# Over time I want to try making mods for other games and join the modding community and make games more enjoyable for others to play.
# Eventually, I want to own a gaming company that can make games that are enjoyable for gamers across the globe.
